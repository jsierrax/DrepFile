    "qualifications": "A human becoming! Rooted in a legacy of service and innovation, I bring a business and marketing background combined with technical expertise in blockchain. I completed Emurgo’s Haskell Programming V2.0 course in 2021, specializing in functional programming to write Cardano smart contracts. Since 2019, I’ve supported initiatives like Catalyst, GimbaLabs, and ODIN, working to close Web 3 access gaps for Spanish-speaking and underserved communities. As host of Sala de Café, I foster global blockchain discussions to drive inclusivity and adoption.\n\nAs cofounder of Cardano Confederation, I co-lead ethical, decentralized solutions for underdeveloped regions, creating opportunities and leveling the playing field. Appointed to the Intersect Interim Constitutional Council and elected to the Cardano-Intersect Product Committee in 2024, I help shape governance and adoption strategies. With a human-first approach, I leverage Web 3 to empower communities and solve real-world challenges.\n",
